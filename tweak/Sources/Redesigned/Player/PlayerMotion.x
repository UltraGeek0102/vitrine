// Player redesign: Animated artwork, the track's Canvas or Apple Music's animated cover behind the player,
// the way the Music app draws it. The clip runs edge to edge from the top, sharp to near its foot, where
// it dissolves into the color of its last rows, drawn on down to the bottom of the field, so it ends in
// its own color rather than on the Fluid field. A blur comes in from the seam (from above the controls for a
// Canvas as tall as the screen) and lies under the controls; behind the lyrics the whole clip is blurred.
// The player's square cover goes while a clip plays, so a track without one keeps its cover over Fluid
// (PlayerField.x keeps the field Fluid for this choice). The player's ⋯ menu switches between Animated
// and Fluid at once (Shared/Player/SpeedPitch.h).
//
// The clip is a subview of the field, not of the background plane: the plane's layout brings the field to
// the front on every pass, and a sibling would end up under it. Each of the field's layout passes attaches
// it (SGRPlayerMotionFieldLaidOut), so a clip that came in before the player first opened, or a field
// Spotify built again, gets it.
//
// The clip holds still when the moving field does (SGRField.m): out of a window, with the app not in front,
// while the player opens or closes, and while the song is paused. Under Reduce Motion and in Low Power Mode
// no clip plays at all: the cover stays over Fluid, as for a track without one, until both are off again.
// While a clip is showing, the Fluid field under it is held still too, and once the clip has faded in it is
// hidden (the field's covered): the field's color is what shows above the clip on the pull that dismisses.
//
// The clip is dimmed by how bright it is (SGRPlayerClipDim): three of its frames are measured as it comes in,
// so a white Canvas is drawn darker than a black one and the white text over it keeps its contrast.
//
// A track that changes while the player cannot be seen (out of a window, or with the app not in front, which a
// locked phone's player is while it stays in its window) takes the last clip away at once, without a fade, so
// the last track's clip does not greet the player as it opens.
//
// The clip and the cover cross over: the clip fades in from its first frame (the poster, under the video
// until the video has decoded one) as the cover fades out, and fades out as the cover comes back. A clip
// that has drawn no frame of its own after kGiveUp seconds on screen is given up, and the cover comes back.
// On a skip the last clip stays a moment (kHandOver), so a clip already in the store (the next track's is
// fetched ahead, SGMotionFollower) crosses over it with no cover between.
//
// Spotify's music video (Switch to video) draws in one of three of its units, each told by its video surface
// as the video comes and goes: while one shows it, the clip goes and the cover comes back, as for Fluid.
