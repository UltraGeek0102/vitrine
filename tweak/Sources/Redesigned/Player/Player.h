// The player redesign (screen key "player"): Spotify's full screen player kept, with its controller,
// units, controls and card list, and restyled from the Kit. Every control stays Spotify's own, so its
// action, state and accessibility do too; the redesign adds the artwork field behind it, glass behind
// the header buttons, bare glyphs for previous, play and next, a lyrics glyph in the footer, and one
// screen with nothing under it: every card is collapsed and the player does not scroll. The lyrics
// come to the player itself, the way the Music app shows them, when the lyrics glyph is tapped.
//
//     PlayerField.x      the switch's flags and rows, the field in the background plane, the cover it reads
//     PlayerArtwork.x    the cover's corners, shadow and paused shrink; the lyric preview as Spotify's setting has it
//     PlayerHeader.x     glass behind the close and more buttons
//     PlayerControls.x   previous, play and next as bare glyphs, shuffle and repeat hidden on request, monospaced times
//     PlayerFooter.x     share gone, lyrics, Connect and queue as one row of three glyphs
//     DJPlayer.x         the AI DJ's player (its own units): skip glyphs, a four glyph footer row, over the shared
//                        play glyph, lowered row and Connect of PlayerControls.x and PlayerFooter.x
//     PlayerCards.x      every card under the player collapsed, so the list closes up
//     PlayerScroll.x     the list held at its top, so the player is one screen and cannot be scrolled up,
//                        and its pull held off while the progress bar is scrubbed
//     PlayerLyrics.x     the lyrics in the player: the cover as a thumbnail, the title up beside it
//     PlayerGestures.x   the gestures' hookup
//     PlayerMorph.x      the open and close grown out of the now playing bar's card, the cover flown
//     PlayerMotion.x     Animated artwork: the Canvas or Apple Music's animated cover behind the player
//     PlayerVisualiser.m the Visualizer background: a calm spectrum of the song in the cover's colors, read
//                        through SGRSpectrum.m from the audio effects' tap on Spotify's output
//     PlayerMenu.m       the more button's system menu: Share, Add to playlist and Add to queue on top, then
//                        speed, pitch and reverb, the backgrounds it can switch to, and Spotify's other rows
//                        under More (Redesigned/ContextMenu)
//     PlayerSettings.m   the Player page in Mod Settings, led by a showcase of the player
//     PlayerFree.x       a Spotify Free account given the player mode these units belong to
//
// Speed and pitch, once the redesign's own, are Shared/Player/SpeedPitch.h's; PlayerHeader.x still hands
// the more button over, so a menu opened from it is taken for the player's, and hands it to PlayerMenu.m,
// which opens it as the system menu.
//
